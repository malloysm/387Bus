# Bus - LED Dance Floor

Background: Dance Floor has 9 panels each with 9 RGB LEDs, which results in a total of 81 LEDs. Each LED is controlled by 3 bits so there will be 243 bits in total. 

Topology: Ring - reduces the amount of wire needed to connect the LEDs and reduces the distance the distance for the data to travel. Connecting the LEDs with twisted pair cables will allow high speed data transmission (Cat5 - 100Mbps)
